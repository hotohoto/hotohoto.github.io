## terms

- entity
- identity
- identifier
  - refers to entity which has identity
- claim
- authentication
  - process of confirming the truth of some claim
- subscriber
- end entity
  - a subscriber
- subject
- CA(Certificate Authority)
  - a certificate issuer
  - CA issues certificates to subscribers
- leaf certificates
  - certificate of end entity
- root certificates
  - certificates for CA
  - top certificates for certificate chains
- intermediate certificates
  - certificates for CA
  - middle certificates for certificate chains
- relying party
  - a certificate user

(Additionally)

- RA(Registration Authority)
- VA(Validation Authority)
- Web PKI
- Internal PKI
- SAN(Certificate Alternative Name)
- CSR(Certificate Signing Request)
  - contains public key
  - mostly it's sent or uploaded to CA on the process of getting the certificate

## MAC

(MAC is not related to PKI (?))

- MAC (Message Authentication Code)
  - hash value to be used as if checksum
  - can be generated from the contents and the shared code
  - verifies both data integrity and authenticity
- HMAC
  - specific type of MAC

## Signature

- Signature
  - make use of public key and private key
  - verified using public key
  - generated with the private key
  - holds not-repudiation property
    - the private key holder can't deny (repudiate) the fact that they signed some data.
  - RSA can be used

## Public key cryptography

- also called asymmetric cryptography
- public key
  - encrypts data that can be decrypted by the private key
- private key
  - can encrypt data that can be verified
  - can sign data
  - it's important for the owner to keep this safe
  - formally this should be made by the end user. But, for the convenience, CA provides a pair of keys without requesting CSR from the user.
- algorithms
  - RSA
- not fast

## Symmetric key cryptography

- algorithms
  - AES
  - DES
  - ...
- fast

## process(SSL Handshake)

- client sends hello to server
  - cryptographic information
    - TLS/SSL version
    - CipherSuites list in the order of preference
  - random bytes
  - data compression methods supported by the client
- server sends hello to client
  - cipher suite chosen
  - session ID
  - random bytes
  - server certificate
  - client certificate request (optional)
    - types of certificates which are supported
    - list of acceptable CA
- client verifies server certificate
- client check cryptographic parameters
- client sends random bytes for secret key
  - client and server will compute the shared secret key from the bytes
  - encrypted with server's public key
  - later both client and server will use the shared secret key to exchange messages
- client sends client certificate (if required)
  - random bytes encrypted with the client's private key
  - with client's certificate
- server verifies client certificate (if required)
- client sends "finished"
  - encrypted with the shared secret key
- server sends "finished"
  - encrypted with the shared secret key
- exchange messages
  - encrypted with the shared secret key

## Standards

- Real world use cases
  - most certificates are `X.509` v3 certificates.
  - They're defined using `ASN.1` and usually serialized as PEM-encoded DER.
  - The corresponding private keys are usually represented as `PKCS#8` objects, also serialized as PEM-encoded DER.
  - If you use Java or Microsoft you might run into `PKCS#7` and `PKCS#12` envelope formats.
- `PKCS#1`
  - definition for implementing a public key
- `PKCS#7`
  - a guideline how to ...
    - send messages
    - sign messages
    - ...
- `PKCS#8`
  - syntax for storing private key information
  - `PKCS#8` private key may be encrypted with a passphrase using the `PKCS#5`
- `PKCS#12`
  - how to bundle many cryptography objects as a single file
  - successor of MS's PFX
  - file extensions
    - `.p12`
    - `.pfx`
- `X.509`
  - standard defining the format of public key certificates
  - TLS uses this
- `ASN.1`
  - standard interface description language
  - supports cross platform serialization and deserialization
  - encoding rules
    - `BER`(Basic Encoding Rules)
    - `DER`(Distinguished Encoding Rules)
      - binary format
      - composed of type-length-value
      - subset of `DER`
    - `JER`(JSON Encoding Rules)
    - `XER`(XML Encoding Rules)
    - ...

## file extensions

(encodings, also used as extensions)

- `.der`
  - binary file encoded in DER
  - may include
    - `.crt` or `.cer`
  - type-length-value
- `.pem`
  - text file encoded in Base64 (base64 encoded der file)
  - may include
    - one or more certificates along with the public keys
    - private key
    - certificate signing request
  - https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1421.txt

(common extensions)

- `.crt`
  - for certificates
  - common among unix/linux systems
- `.cer`
  - microsoft convention
  - used by IE
- `.key`
  - for public keys or private `PKCS#8` keys.

## Java details

- KeyStore
  - managed by KeyManager
  - contains private keys usually
  - required when a server is running on an SSL connection
  - set by `-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore`
- TrustStore
  - managed by TrustManager
  - contains public keys and the certificates usually
  - set by `-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore`

## OpenSSL commands

### Read a certificate

```bash
openssl x509 -in certificate.pem -text
```

### Create a private key

```bash
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out key.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:4096
```

or

```bash
openssl genrsa -out key.pem 4096
```

### Create a private key with encryption

```bash
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out key.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:4096 -aes128
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out key.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:4096 -aes192
```

### Create a private key and CSR

```bash
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout key.pem -out certificate.pem
```

- `-nodes` : apply no encryption to the private key

### Create a self-signed certificate from a private key

```bash
openssl req -key key.pem -x509 -days 365 -out certificate.pem
```

### Create a private key and the certificate

```bash
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout key.pem -x509 -days 365 -out certificate.pem
```

### PEM to DER

```bash
openssl x509 -in cert.crt -outform der -out cert.der
```

### DER to PEM

```bash
openssl x509 -in cert.crt -inform der -outform pem -out cert.pem
```

## good practices

- Use short-lived certificates
- Use passive revocation
- Automates certificate renewal
- Don't disable certificate path
